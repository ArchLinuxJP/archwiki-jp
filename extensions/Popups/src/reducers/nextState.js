/**
 * Creates the next state tree from the current state tree and some updates.
 *
 * N.B. OO.copy doesn't copy Element instances, whereas $.extend does.
 * However, OO.copy does copy properties whose values are undefined or null,
 * whereas $.extend doesn't. Since the state tree contains an Element instance
 * - the preview.activeLink property - and we want to copy undefined/null into
 * the state we need to manually iterate over updates and check with
 * hasOwnProperty to copy over to the new state.
 *
 * In [change listeners](/docs/change_listener.md), for example, we talk about
 * the previous state and the current state (the `prevState` and `state`
 * parameters, respectively). Since
 * [reducers](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html) take the current
 * state and an action and make updates, "next state" seems appropriate.
 *
 * @param {Object} state
 * @param {Object} updates
 * @return {Object}
